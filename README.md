# 30 DAYS OF JS &nbsp;💻

'Cause why not? I really like JavaScript and the power that it possesses amazes me. Each day, I'll be doing a JS (Vanilla JS) exercise from [Wes Sob's](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30) JavaScript30 Challenge.

- *Day 01* - **Drum Kit &nbsp;🎵**: Plays a unique sound whenever a certain key is pressed. The key things which can be learned from this exercise are the use of ```data-key``` and eventListener type ```transitionend``` which is useful to remove class(es) from an element after its transition(s) end, rather than removing the specific class(es) in a ```setTimeout``` function with the time being equal to time duration of transition.

- *Day 02* - **CSS & JS Clock &nbsp;🕓**: A clock created using CSS and JS as the name clearly suggests. The key things which can be learned from this exercise are the use of ```transform-origin```, which can be used to transform an element about the ends of X axis, or for that matter, about any point, rather than the center point (which is the default case), and how to maintain continuity of clock hands (something which I did on my own), which can otherwise cause the clock hands to rewind back to start position after completion of a rotation.

- *Day 03* - **CSS Var &nbsp;🎨**: Change certain CSS properties on changing input values. The key thing which can be learned from this exercise is the use of variables in CSS, which not only allow you to reuse them throughout your document conveniently, but can also be manipulated easily using JS.

- *Day 04* - **Array Cardio 1 &nbsp;💪**: Going over different array methods. It's good to know what all actions we can perform on an array, and how they can be used to manipulate the array. Methods like map and reduce can be used effectively in various situations to get the desired results with minimal effort and code.

- *Day 05* - **Flex Panels Image Gallery &nbsp;🌆**: Full screen vertical image gallery with animations. The key things which can be learned here are the use of ```display: flex```, ```align-items``` and ```justify-content```, to perfectly align your content on a webpage, one can even make use of flexbox(es) inside another flexbox for horizontal and vertical alignment of elements, and how simple transitions can add so much more to the UX of a webpage. Rather than using the predefined animation paths (like linear, ease-in-out, etc), try creating custom cubic-bezier paths to achieve fun and unique transitions and the best way to try this is using the browser console.

- *Day 06* - **Type Ahead &nbsp;🔍** Search box which searches through a list of objects. The key things which can be learned here are the use of inbuilt ```fetch()``` function for getting API response and ```regex``` to search the input string pattern inside a string. Also, a bit of styling gives a modern and appealing look to the otherwise boring input field.

- *Day 07* - **Array Cardio 2 &nbsp;💪** Went over few more important array functions.
