# 30 DAYS OF JS &nbsp;ðŸ’»

'Cause why not? I really like JavaScript and the power that it possesses amazes me. Each day, I'll be doing a JS (Vanilla JS) exercise from [Wes Sob's](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30) JavaScript30 Challenge.

- *Day 01* - **Drum Kit &nbsp;ðŸŽµ**: Plays a unique sound whenever a certain key is pressed. The key things which can be learned from this exercise are the use of ```data-key``` and eventListener type ```transitionend``` which is useful to remove class(es) from an element after its transition(s) end, rather than removing the specific class(es) in a ```setTimeout``` function with the time being equal to time duration of transition.
